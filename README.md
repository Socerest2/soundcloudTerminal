Utilize SoundCloud within a terminal environment. Play SoundCloud songs by searching a song or an artist. If you plan to use any of the code featured in this project please give me credit with a link to my github!

## Dependencies
```
npm install puppeteer -g
npm install terminal-image -g
```

## Use
```
node main.js
```
**Make sure you're in the same directory as ```main.js``` or it may not run!**

Note: I would've made an npm package but I've been having trouble packaging it with puppeteer, if you know of a solution please let me know.
